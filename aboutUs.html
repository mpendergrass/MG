			<h3>Firm Overview</h3>			

			<p class="subtitle">In April 1997, J. R. Murphy and John M. Grantland founded the firm along with the help of a paralegal and receptionist.  With the mission of providing high-quality legal services with uncompromising integrity and uncommon value, Murphy & Grantland flourished and more than doubled its client base and workload.  In the next decade Murphy & Grantland expanded to include over a dozen attorneys, paralegals, legal assistants, file clerks, as well as a human resource area, bookkeeping area, and information technology area.  After outgrowing three different office locations, Murphy & Grantland built its permanent location at 4406-B Forest Drive in Columbia.</p>
